# LAB \#3 – Using Inheritance and Polymorphism

## Exercise 1

Write a Java application that implements different types of insurance
policies for employees of an organization.

Let **Insurance** be an abstract superclass and **Health** and **Life**
two of its subclasses that describe respectively health insurance and
life insurance.

The **Insurance** class defines an instance variable of type **String**
to describe the **type of insurance** and an instance variable of type
**double** to hold the **monthly cost** of that insurance.

Implement the **get** methods for both variables of class **Insurance**.
Declare also two **abstract** methods named **setInsuranceCost()** and
**displayInfo()** for this class.

The **Life** and **Health** class should implement **setInsuranceCost**
and **display** methods by setting the appropriate monthly fee and
display the information for each insurance type.

Write a driver class to test this hierarchy. This application should ask
the user to enter the type of insurance and its monthly fee. Then, will
create the appropriate object (Life or Health) and display the insurance
information.

As you create each insurance object, place an **Insurance** reference to
each new **Insurance** object into an array. Each class has its own
**setInsuranceCost** method. Write **a polymorphic** screen manager that
walks through the array sending **setInsuranceCost** messages to each
object in the array and displaying this information on the screen.

## Exercise 2

Create an abstract class called GameTester. The GameTester class
includes a name for the game tester and a boolean value representing the
status (full-time, part-time).

Include an abstract method to determine the salary, with full-time game
testers getting a base salary of \$3000 and part-time game testers
getting \$20 per hour.

Create two subclasses called FullTimeGameTester, PartTimeGameTester.
Create a console application that demonstrates how to create objects of
both subclasses. Allow the user to choose game tester type and enter the
number of hours for the part-time testers.

## Exercise 3

CityToronto bank provides mortgages for individuals and businesses up to
\$300,000. Write a Java application that keeps track of mortgages and
computes the total amount owed at any time (mortgage amount + interest).

Design the following classes to implement your application:

**Mortgage** – an abstract class that implements the *MortgageConstants*
interface. A Mortgage includes a mortgage number, customer name, amount
of mortgage, interest rate, and term.

Don’t allow mortgage amounts over \$300,000. Force any mortgage term
that is not defined in the *MortgageConstants* interface to a
short-term, one year loan. Create a *getMortgageInfo* method to display
all the mortgage data.

**MortgageConstants** – includes constant values for *short-term* (one
year), *medium-term* (three years) and *long-term* (5 years) mortgages.
It also contains constants for bank name and the maximum mortgage
amount.

**BusinessMortgage** – extends Mortgage. Its constructor sets the
interest rate to 1% over the current prime rate.

**PersonalMortgage** - extends Mortgage. Its constructor sets the
interest rate to 2% over the current prime rate.

**ProcessMortgage** – a main class that create an array of 3 mortgages.
Prompt the user for the current interest rate. Then in a loop prompts
the user for a mortgage type and all relevant information for that
mortgage. Store the created Mortgage objects in the array. When data
entry is complete, display all mortgages.
